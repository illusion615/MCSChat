# Real-time Streaming Speech Feature

## Overview

The real-time streaming speech feature enables immediate audio feedback during text streaming, significantly improving user experience by reducing perceived latency and creating a more responsive conversational interface.

## Key Features

### üéØ Real-time Speech Processing
- **Immediate Response**: Speech begins as soon as the first complete sentence is detected during streaming
- **Sentence Boundary Detection**: Intelligent parsing to identify speakable chunks without breaking mid-sentence
- **Queue Management**: Sequential processing of speech chunks to maintain natural flow
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with any streaming text source (DirectLine, API responses, simulated typing)

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Streaming Speech State Management
```javascript
streamingSpeechState: {
    isEnabled: false,           // Auto-speak enabled/disabled
    speechBuffer: '',           // Current text buffer for processing
    lastSpeechIndex: 0,        // Last processed character index
    sentenceBuffer: [],        // Extracted complete sentences
    speechQueue: [],           // Queue of text chunks to speak
    isProcessingSpeech: false, // Speech processing status
    minChunkLength: 30         // Minimum characters for chunk processing
}
```

#### Key Methods

**`initializeStreamingSpeech()`**
- Checks user preferences for auto-speak functionality
- Initializes streaming speech state for new messages

**`extractCompleteSentences(text, startIndex)`**
- Parses text buffer to find complete sentences
- Uses intelligent boundary detection (`.`, `!`, `?` with proper context)
- Cleans markdown and HTML formatting for speech
- Returns array of speakable sentences and new processing index

**`processStreamingSpeech(fullText, isUserMessage)`**
- Main processing method called during content updates
- Extracts new sentences since last processing
- Adds sentences to speech queue
- Triggers queue processing if not already running

**`processSpeechQueue()`**
- Sequential processing of queued speech chunks
- Integrates with aiCompanion for actual speech synthesis
- Includes timing delays between chunks for natural flow
- Handles errors gracefully without interrupting streaming

### üé≠ Multi-Provider Speech Engine Integration

- **Incremental Processing**: Only processes new text since last update
- **Smart Chunking**: Balances responsiveness with natural speech flow
- **Markdown Cleaning**: Removes formatting artifacts before speech synthesis
- **Memory Management**: Efficient queue management prevents memory buildup

#### Speech Queue Management
- **Sequential Processing**: Maintains conversation flow and prevents overlapping speech
- **Interrupt Handling**: Clean stops for new messages or user actions
- **Timing Control**: Natural pauses between speech chunks
- **Error Isolation**: Individual chunk failures don't affect entire conversation

## Integration Points

### Message Renderer Integration
- **Stream Initialization**: `handleStreamingMessageDirect()` sets up speech state
- **Content Processing**: `updateStreamingContent()` triggers speech processing
- **Finalization**: `finalizeStreamingMessage()` handles remaining content

### AI Companion Integration
- **Speech Synthesis**: Uses existing aiCompanion.speakText() methods
- **Settings Management**: Respects user speech preferences
- **Provider Switching**: Seamless integration with provider selection

### User Interface Integration
- **Settings Panel**: Enhanced UI for provider selection and configuration
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time feedback on speech processing status
- **Error Notifications**: User-friendly messages for provider fallbacks

## Usage Examples

### Basic Streaming Speech
```javascript
// Initialize message renderer with speech engine
const messageRenderer = new MessageRenderer(elements, { speechEngine });

// Start streaming message (automatically initializes speech)
await messageRenderer.handleStreamingMessageDirect({
    messageId: 'msg-001',
    content: 'Initial content...'
});

// Update content (triggers speech processing)
messageRenderer.updateStreamingContent(messageDiv, 'Growing content with complete sentences.');
```

### Provider Configuration
```javascript
// Set speech provider
await speechEngine.setProvider('web_speech'); // or 'azure'

// Configure speech parameters
speechEngine.setSpeechRate(1.2);
speechEngine.setSpeechVolume(0.9);
speechEngine.setAutoSpeak(true);

// Handle provider fallback notifications
window.addEventListener('speechProviderFallback', (event) => {
    console.log('Provider fallback:', event.detail.message);
});
```
