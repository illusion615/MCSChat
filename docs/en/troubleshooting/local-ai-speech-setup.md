# Local AI Speech Setup Guide

## Overview

The Local AI speech provider uses Transformers.js to run speech synthesis models directly in your browser. This provides high-quality speech without requiring a server connection, but comes with some setup considerations.

## ‚úÖ What Works Out of the Box

**Enhanced Web Speech API (Recommended)**
- ‚úÖ **Instant availability** - No downloads required
- ‚úÖ **High-quality voices** - Natural-sounding speech synthesis
- ‚úÖ **Universal compatibility** - Works on all modern browsers
- ‚úÖ **Zero setup** - Ready to use immediately
- ‚úÖ **Real-time streaming** - Perfect for streaming speech feature

## üî¨ Local AI Models (Experimental)

### Prerequisites

**Browser Requirements:**
- Chrome/Edge 88+ or Firefox 85+ or Safari 14+
- WebAssembly support (standard in modern browsers)
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- Stable internet connection for initial model download

**Network Requirements:**
- Access to CDN servers (cdn.jsdelivr.net, unpkg.com)
- Ability to download 50-200MB model files
- CORS support for cross-origin requests

### How It Works

1. **Library Loading**: Downloads Transformers.js (2.17.2) from CDN
2. **Model Download**: Downloads SpeechT5 model from Hugging Face
3. **Browser Processing**: Runs speech synthesis in Web Worker
4. **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to Web Speech API if anything fails

### Setup Steps

**Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)**
1. Select "Local AI Models" in speech provider dropdown
2. Wait for initialization (30-60 seconds first time)
3. Check browser console for progress
4. System automatically falls back to Web Speech API if failed

**Option 2: Manual Testing**
1. Open browser developer console
2. Navigate to `test-speech-quick.html`
3. Select "Local AI Models" provider
4. Monitor console for loading progress and any errors

### Expected Behavior

**First Time Use:**
- ‚è≥ 30-60 seconds initial loading time
- üì• Large file downloads (speech models)
- üíæ Models cached in browser for subsequent use
- üîÑ Automatic fallback to Web Speech API if loading fails

**Subsequent Use:**
- ‚ö° Faster loading (models cached)
- üéØ High-quality speech synthesis
- üîí Offline capability (after initial download)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to load Transformers.js"**
```
Solution: Network connectivity issue or CDN blocked
- Check internet connection
- Try different network (VPN may help)
- System will automatically fallback to Web Speech API
```

**"Model download timeout"**
```
Solution: Large model files take time to download
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Wait up to 60 seconds for initial download
- Check browser console for progress updates
- Fallback to Web Speech API will occur automatically
```

**"Insufficient memory errors"**
```
Solution: Browser memory limitations
- Close other browser tabs
- Restart browser
- Use Web Speech API for lighter resource usage
```

**"CORS errors or CDN blocked"**
```
Solution: Network restrictions
- Corporate firewalls may block CDN access
- Use Web Speech API as reliable alternative
- Check browser console for specific error details
```

### Browser Console Debugging

**Check Loading Progress:**
```javascript
// Open browser console and look for these messages:
[SpeechWorker] Trying to load from: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/...
[SpeechWorker] Successfully loaded from: ...
[SpeechWorker] Loading TTS model...
```

**Verify Fallback Behavior:**
```javascript
// Look for fallback notifications:
[SpeechEngine] Local AI provider failed to initialize, falling back to Web Speech API
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Better Local AI Performance:**
- **Use Chrome/Edge**: Best WebAssembly performance
- **Ensure RAM**: Close unnecessary browser tabs
- **Stable Network**: Consistent download speeds
- **Cache Benefits**: Subsequent uses are much faster

**For Best User Experience:**
- **Use Web Speech API**: Immediate availability, excellent quality
- **Save Local AI for Specific Use Cases**: Privacy-focused scenarios

## üìä Provider Comparison

| Feature | Web Speech API | Local AI | Azure Speech |
|---------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| **Setup Time** | Instant | 30-60s first use | Account required |

| **Offline** | No | Yes (after download) | No |
| **Privacy** | Browser-based | Fully local | Cloud-based |
| **Resource Usage** | Low | High | Low |
| **Reliability** | Very High | Medium | High |
| **Recommended Use** | ‚úÖ Default choice | üî¨ Privacy/offline | üíº Enterprise |

## üéØ Recommendations

### For Most Users
**Use Enhanced Web Speech API**
- Immediate availability
- Excellent voice quality
- Perfect for streaming speech
- No setup or downloads required

### For Privacy-Conscious Users
**Try Local AI Models**

- Higher resource usage but maximum privacy

### For Enterprise Users
**Consider Azure Speech Services**
- Professional-grade neural voices
- Advanced features like SSML
- Requires Azure account and configuration
- **Now Enhanced**: Improved error handling and language detection

## üîß Recent Fixes & Improvements

### Speech Recognition Error Handling (Latest Update)
**Fixed: "transcript.trim is not a function" Error**
- **Problem**: Voice input could fail when speech recognition returned non-string data
- **Solution**: Added robust type checking and data sanitization for all speech providers
- **Impact**: Improved reliability across Web Speech API, Azure Speech, and Local AI providers

**Enhanced Azure Speech Compatibility**
- **Fixed**: `TypeError: this.privAudioSource.id is not a function` during Azure Speech initialization
- **Improvement**: Proper constructor usage for language detection features
- **Result**: Stable Azure Speech SDK integration with multi-language support

### Robust Voice Input Processing
```javascript
// Now handles multiple data types safely:
- String responses: "Hello world" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Processed directly
- Object responses: {text: "Hello world"} ‚Üí ‚úÖ Extracts text property  
- Mixed types: All safely converted to string ‚Üí ‚úÖ Universal compatibility
```

### Error Recovery
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Azure Speech ‚Üí Web Speech API ‚Üí Local AI
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even if preferred provider fails
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and fallback notifications

## üöÄ Quick Test

Want to test what's working on your system right now?
